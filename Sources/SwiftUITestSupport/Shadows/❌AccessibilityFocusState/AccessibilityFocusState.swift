/// A property wrapper type that can read and write a value that SwiftUI updates
/// as the focus of any active accessibility technology, such as VoiceOver,
/// changes.
///
/// Use this capability to request that VoiceOver or other accessibility
/// technologies programmatically focus on a specific element, or to determine
/// whether VoiceOver or other accessibility technologies are focused on
/// particular elements. Use `accessibilityFocused(_:equals:)` or
/// `View/accessibilityFocused(_:)` in conjunction with this property
/// wrapper to identify accessibility elements for which you want to get
/// or set accessibility focus. When accessibility focus enters the modified accessibility element,
/// the framework updates the wrapped value of this property to match a given
/// prototype value. When accessibility focus leaves, SwiftUI resets the wrapped value
/// of an optional property to `nil` or the wrapped value of a Boolean property to `false`.
/// Setting the property's value programmatically has the reverse effect, causing
/// accessibility focus to move to whichever accessibility element is associated with the updated value.
///
///  In the example below, when `notification` changes, and its  `isPriority` property
///  is `true`, the accessibility focus moves to the notification `Text` element above the rest of the
///  view's content:
///
/// ```swift
///     struct CustomNotification: Equatable {
///         var text: String
///         var isPriority: Bool
///     }
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         @Binding var notification: CustomNotification?
///         @AccessibilityFocusState var isNotificationFocused: Bool
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 if let notification = self.notification {
///                     Text(notification.text)
///                         .accessibilityFocused($isNotificationFocused)
///                 }
///                 Text("The main content for this view.")
///             }
///             .onChange(of: notification) { notification in
///                 if (notification?.isPriority == true)  {
///                     isNotificationFocused = true
///                 }
///             }
///
///         }
///     }
/// ```
/// To allow for cases where accessibility focus is completely absent from the
/// tree of accessibility elements, or accessibility technologies are not
/// active, the wrapped value must be either optional or Boolean.
///
/// Some initializers of `AccessibilityFocusState` also allow specifying
/// accessibility technologies, determining to which types of accessibility
/// focus this binding applies. If you specify no accessibility technologies,
/// SwiftUI uses an aggregate of any and all active accessibility technologies.
